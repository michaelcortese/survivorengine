## in typescript with Discord.js

## TODO:
- [ ] Switch to using card enums for error validation rather than string literals
- [ ] Implement tribal council (yikes!)
- [ ] Refactor centralized config
- [ ] Unique query parameters for duplicate card images (discord will refuse to render image embeds with the same url)
- [ ] Reset game command
- [ ] Tribal council cards and leader (equal distribution)
- [ ] See distance between tribal council cards
- [ ] Camp raid (steal next draw)
